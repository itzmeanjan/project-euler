# project-euler
Another implementation of Project Euler Problems :wink: #ProjectEuler100

## motivation

I just came across one freecodecamp [post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/projecteuler100-coding-challenge-competitive-programming/), which tempted me to accept _#ProjectEuler100_ challenge. It's not like that prior to this I never thought of solving these beautiful mathematical problems, but I never opensourced it. So it's looks like a great opportunity to me, where I can challenge my thinking capability.

## solutions

I'm planning to stick to _GoLang_ as language of implementation. All solutions will stay in this [directory](./projecteuler/).

### [problem 1](./projecteuler/problem1.go)

#### statement

_If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23._

_Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000._

#### solution

233168

#### explanation

Iterating using a simple for loop _( starting from 3 )_, upto _(X -  1)_, where _X_ is given, and checking divisibility of current number by either 3 or 5. If it's divisible, then we add it up to _sum_ variable. And finally return _sum_, holding expected output.

### [problem 2](./projecteuler/problem2.go)

#### statement

_Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:_

_1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ..._

_By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms._

#### solution

4613732

#### explanation

Using dynamic programming style, for calculating fibonacci terms, recursive strategy will be straightforward but run slow ( and no doubt very expensive ). Starting with a slice of two elements `{1, 2}`, we'll keep calculating next fibonacci term until most recently computed term crosses _4,000,000_. And in each iteration, it'll check whether this term is even or not. If even, we'll add it up to _sum_ variable, which is initialized with _2_ ( because at very beginning _fibArr_, was only holding _2_ as even number )

**More coming soon ...** :wink:
